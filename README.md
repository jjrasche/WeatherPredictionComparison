# Weather Prediction Accuracy

This was my first experiences with full-stack web design. A project started mostly to gain knowledge, but partly due what I percieved as gross inaccuracies in weather forcasts this summer. 

## Design

### Python batch job which:
* pulls current weather data from wunderground.com
* uses current data compared with past data's predictions to rate the prediction* save both prediction and comparison to database

### php backend
* query database

### html and jQuery frontend  (chart.js library)
* create ability to select
** length of prediction
** type of prediction 
* display bar graph and statistical analysis
